# NotesRevision
I have chosen and developed this website with my own creativity because I love to structure and organize the information I learn.So,whatever I'm currently learning related to coding,I just add that to my website,which I have named NotesRevision.I'll continue to develop this website as I learn and keep modifying it with the technologies I acquire.
